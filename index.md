### CPSC 120

* Lab 11
    In Lab 11 Part 2, we revisit the Hi-Lo game from our previous labs, but including the use of classes in which we learned that week. My favorite part of doing this lab was using the knowledge of setting up the accessors and mutators of classes to create variables to use for the Hi-Lo game.

* Lab 08 
    In Lab 08 Part 2, we use nested for loops to create a pattern that showed on the BASH shell. My favorite part of this lab was debugging the loops and patterns. My lab partner and I was done with the logic of the lab, but fine-tuning the output to the expected output was super thought-provoking and insightful to how programmers would debug their programs. 

* Lab 02
    In Lab 02 Part 1, we used the concepts of doing Mad Libs to get us familiarized to using strings. We used std::cin and std::cout to gather input and output text onto the BASH shell to the user. My favorite part of this lab was learning how string variables were gathered and used for outputs.
